#KASTORS benchmarks

##Introduction

KASTORS benchmarks suite has been designed to evaluate the implementation of
the OpenMP dependent task paradigm, introduced as part of the OpenMP 4.0
specifications.

Its development is public [here](https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/kastors).

A quick presentation of the benchmark kernels can be found in the user guide [here](README.md).

Performance evaluation of all kernels on two numa machines can be found [here](performances.md).

A first archive can be found [here](kastors.tgz).

This work has been described in the paper **Evaluation of the OpenMP dependent tasks with the KASTORS benchmark suite** submitted and accepted at [IWOMP2014](http://portais.fieb.org.br/senai/iwomp2014/).
